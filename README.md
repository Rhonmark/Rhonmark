# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ - I'm [@Rhonmark](https://github.com/Rhonmark), a college student with a passion for exploring the realms of front-end and back-end development. I'm currently navigating the exciting worlds of JavaScript for dynamic web interfaces and Java for server-side possibilities.

## ðŸŒ± I'm actively enhancing my skills in JavaScript and Java.

## ðŸ’¼ I'm eager to collaborate on projects that allow me to apply and expand my knowledge in both JavaScript and Java. If you have an idea that involves these technologies and is open to a learning collaboration, I'd love to be a part of it! Let's learn and build something together.

## ðŸ“« Feel free to connect with me via email at [whickhcker@gmail.com](mailto:whickhcker@gmail.com). I'm open to discussions, learning opportunities, and any projects that involve the dynamic pairing of JavaScript and Java.

Looking forward to connecting with fellow developers and fellow learners! ðŸš€
